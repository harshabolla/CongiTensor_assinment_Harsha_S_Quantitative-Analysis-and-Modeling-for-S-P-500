CS - 1 : Quantitative Analysis and Modeling for S&P 500
Overview
The meteoric increase in compute power and advances in Machine Learning have given rise to
a variety of use-cases for mechanical/algorithmic trading. Quantitative funds across the world
use a plethora of techniques to forecast market prices, volumes and general market behaviour.
S&P 500 is one of the world’s leading benchmark indices consisting of 500 publicly listed
companies. Your study will be restricted to data from these companies’ price-volume data (as
traded on the New York Stock Exchange)
A detailed data description will be provided further on in this document.
Objective
There are 3 main objectives -
1. Volatility Index - Out of all the 500 stocks in the dataset, establish a weekly volatility
index which ranks stocks on the basis of intraday price movements.
(Weekly volatility Index implies that it is to be calculated on a weekly time frame and both
intraday as well as weekly change in price needs to be used in calculating volatility)
a. Give an exploratory analysis on any one stock describing it’s key statistical
tendencies.
b. The index should rank the stocks from most to least volatile in the selected time
frame.
c. The output needs to be grouped weekly showing the Top 10 Most and Least
Volatile stocks. Both your code and output will be evaluated.
2. Pair Trading - The concept of pair trading suggests that there are stocks whose prices
move together (could have an inverse relationship). More information on pair trading can
be found at https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/pair-trading-basics/
Your objective is to identify the 5 strongest pairs for every year in the dataset (eg. 5
strongest pairs for 2014, 2015 and so on)
3. Binary Classification - Given a stock and it’s data, you have to predict whether it will
close lower than it opened (red) or higher than it opened (green) [Continued on the next
page]
You need to submit your model whose performance will be tested on our test data.
(Will be a subset of the data provided to you).
Your prediction function needs to be standardised to ensure it’s compatibility with our
test function and should follow the following guidelines -
Input Arguments - Ticker Symbol, date (to predict for), Historical Price Series for the
selected stock (up till the mentioned date, but be sure to avoid look
ahead bias)
Function Returns - 1 (for Green), 0 (for Red), 0.5 (For No Confidence)
(A ‘No Confidence’ will be treated as a random prediction and is
better than a wrong prediction)
Note -
● We strongly encourage engineering additional features. To give an example, traders
usually look at candlestick charts and their activity influences the prices. So you could
engineer features to emulate the characteristics of a candlestick eg. Body Size, Upper
Shadow, Lower Shadow etc) which can be easily extracted from the price O,H,L,C data.
● If you are engineering additional features, make sure your function extracts them in real
time before predicting (We are passing the historical price series as an argument to the
function for this purpose itself)
Data Description
The given data has been downloaded from Kaggle and is very clean.
The dataset can be downloaded here and contains the following columns -
● Date - The day when trading took place. Please note that if predicting for 10-01-2019,
you will not have the data up till 09-01-2019 only. Make sure look-ahead bias is avoided
in all your analysis and activities)
● Open - Opening price
● High - Highest price level reached during the day
● Low - Lowest price level reached during the day
● Close - Closing price
● Volume - Number of stocks traded on that day
● Name - Name or Ticker Symbol of the stock
